            all involved together in healthcare in developed modern societies,
            which is a complex ecosystem of interdependent entities. It is one
            of the fastest-growing industries in the whole globe. Existing
            methods and solutions, on the other hand, create obstacles and
            challenges that obstruct the effective delivery of healthcare.
